# Wordle clone

My attempt to recreate a popular online word game called Wordle

### How to play

- Enter you guess into the input at the bottom.
- You have 6 attempts to guess the 5-letter word.
- Hits are available to tell you if letters aren't in the word, or if letters are in the correct location or not.
- Good luck xD

## Get started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/marekzelinka/wordle.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Run the application in dev mode:

   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. Visit [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)
